# requirements.txt — Compatibility shim. DO NOT edit manually.
#
# This file is kept for legacy tooling compatibility (e.g. scripts that
# reference "requirements.txt" directly).
#
# Source of truth for direct dependencies : requirements.in
# Source of truth for pinned installation  : requirements-lock.txt
#
# To regenerate requirements-lock.txt after updating requirements.in, run:
#   pip-compile requirements.in --output-file requirements-lock.txt --strip-extras
#
# For deterministic installs, always use:
#   pip install -r requirements-lock.txt
#
-r requirements-lock.txt
